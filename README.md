### First training task
  1. The chosen language for this training task: PHP

### Requirements
  Requirements in the task: 
  1. If number is divisible by 3 then print -> Hello
  2. If number is divisible by 5 then print -> World
  3. There is also the case where we have numbers that are divisible by 3 and 5.
  4. Example: 15,30,45,60, ...
  5. If number is divisible by 3 and 5 then print -> Hello World

### Explanation
  1. We have 2 inputs here. 
  2. The starting number or iStart ( meaning integer )
  3. The ending number or iEnd ( meaning integer )
  4. Here we use a simple function called printNumbers where we have 2 parameters.
  5. Also added by my side is: Execution time. 
  6. It takes the starting time of the function and also the ending time.

### Validations
  There are some simple validations:
  1. Inputs can`t be empty
  2. If inputs are empty-> Inputs can`t be empty.
  3. Starting number should always be lower than ending number
  4. If starting number is bigger -> Starting number can`t be greater than ending number
