### First training task
  The chosen language for this training task: PHP

### Requirements
  Requirements in the task: 
  If number is divisible by 3 then print -> Hello
  If number is divisible by 5 then print -> World
  There is also the case where we have numbers that are divisible by 3 and 5.
  Example: 15,30,45,60, ...
  If number is divisible by 3 and 5 then print -> Hello World

### Explanation
  We have 2 inputs here. 
  The starting number or iStart ( meaning integer )
  The ending number or iEnd ( meaning integer )
  Here we use a simple function called printNumbers where we have 2 parameters.
  Also added by my side is: Execution time. 
  It takes the starting time of the function and also the ending time.

### Validations
  There are some simple validations:
  1. Inputs can`t be empty, otherwise if empty then echoed is: Inputs can`t be empty
  2. Starting number should always be lower than ending number, otherwise echoed is: Starting number can`t be greater than ending number
